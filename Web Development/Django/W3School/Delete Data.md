[Django Delete Data](https://www.w3schools.com/django/django_delete_data.php)

To delete a record in a table, start by getting the record you want to delete:
```python
>>> from members.models import Member
>>> x = Member.objects.all()[5]
```

`x` will now represent the member at index 5,which is "Jane Doe", but to make sure, let us see if that is correct:

```python
>>> x.firstname
```

This should give you this result:

```
'Jane'
```

Now we can delete the record:

```python
>>> x.delete()
```

The result will be:

```
(1, {'members.Member': 1})
```

Which tells us how many items were deleted, and from which Model.

If we look at the Member Model, we can see that 'Jane Doe' is removed from the Model:

```python
>>> Member.objects.all().values()
<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'firstname': 'Emil', 'lastname': 'Refsnes'},
{'id': 2, 'firstname': 'Tobias', 'lastname': 'Refsnes'},
{'id': 3, 'firstname': 'Linus', 'lastname': 'Refsnes'},
{'id': 4, 'firstname': 'Lene', 'lastname': 'Refsnes'},
{'id': 5, 'firstname': 'Stalikken', 'lastname': 'Refsnes'}]>
```
